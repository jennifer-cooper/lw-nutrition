    <div class="mb-12">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-heading text-brand-primary mb-4">What does an Appointment involve?</h3>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">In your initial 45 minute Appointment I will carry out a full nutritional assessment which can involve discussing:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-lg space-y-1">
        <li>Nutritional status (weight, weight history, height, BMI)</li>
        <li>Medical History</li>
        <li>Medications</li>
        <li>Blood results if appropriate</li>
        <li>Symptoms</li>
        <li>Diet</li>
        <li>Lifestyle</li>
        <li>Aims/Goals/Reason for booking</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-lg">We will then discuss the latest evidence and dietary advice and develop an individualised nutritional plan together. Your plan will be emailed to you along with relevant information sheets.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mt-2">Follow up appointments are 30–45 minutes. We will discuss how your diet is going and whether symptoms, blood results, or goals have changed. If needed, we will develop a new plan together.</p>

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-heading text-brand-primary mb-4">Do I need to do anything prior to a consultation?</h3>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">I will send you a form to fill in prior to your appointment so I have a full understanding of what advice you are looking for and what you wish to achieve.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">It would be helpful to have medication lists and blood results handy during an appointment as the more information I have the better the assessment will be.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">You could also keep a food diary for 3–7 days and email it to me prior to the appointment. Write down everything you eat and drink, including portion sizes, cooking methods, and timings. If you have any gut symptoms, note these and the times they occur.</p>

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-heading text-brand-primary mb-4">How much does it cost?</h3>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">My fees for telephone or online appointments (Microsoft Teams) are as follows:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-lg space-y-1">
