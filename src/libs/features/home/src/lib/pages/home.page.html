    <h3 id="about" class="text-3xl font-heading mb-8">About</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">I provide individualised, evidence based, and practical nutrition advice which can help you prevent
      and manage a wide range of health conditions.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">I am a fully registered dietitian with 11 years of clinical experience in the NHS. I have knowledge and
      experience of a range of conditions, but I specialise in Gastroenterology, digestive disorders and gut
      health. I am registered with the Health and Care Professionals Council (HCPC) and I am a member of
      the British Dietetic Association (BDA).</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">I have a particular interest in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      (IBD).</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">I am a mother to a 6 year old son and a 5 year old daughter. I enjoy being outside in nature, walking,
      yoga and outdoor swimming. I love cooking, baking and eating delicious food. I like travelling and
      spending time with my family.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">I believe that nutrition is an essential part of a healthy, happy lifestyle. What we eat has the ability to
      impact our mood, symptoms, and energy levels and decrease our risk of disease. Food is an
      important part of our family and social life and should be enjoyed.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">I believe in a holistic approach to nutrition, as sleep, exercise and mental wellbeing are all equally
      important to improve health and symptoms. </p>
