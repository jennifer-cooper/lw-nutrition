`;ibsDescription=`
  <p>I can help those with digestive disorders including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), to achieve symptom control.</p>
   <br>
  <p>Symptoms of functional gut disorders such as bloating, abdominal pain, wind, constipation and diarrhoea can be debilitating and really affect quality of life.</p>
   <br>
  <p>I have 9 years of experience treating people with functional gut disorders. I use the latest evidence based advice to make an individualised nutritional plan that fits in with your lifestyle.</p>
   <br>
  <p>I am fully trained in the Low FODMAP diet, which is a diet developed by Monash University in Australia and adapted by Kings College London for the UK to help with symptom management in people with IBS. I give practical advice and tips on how to follow the diet, and how to reintroduce foods after following the diet. This is essential in order to determine which foods you may be sensitive to, and to achieve a long term diet that is as varied as possible. Please note that this diet is not appropriate for everyone and other advice may be given to try first.</p>

  <p>I can assess your diet and help you meet your micronutrient and macronutrient needs. I can give you advice on how to manage and prevent symptoms, and how to prevent weight loss and nutritional deficiencies if you are struggling with eating.</p>
